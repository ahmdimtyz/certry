                            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>                 
                            <li>1 tablespoon sambal oelek or homemade sambal</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (thin) or use ½ tablespoon if using thick dark soy sauce</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon Malaysian curry powder</li>
                            <li>3 teaspoons sugar</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text2">Directions:</p>
                        <ol class="text4">
                            <li>Prepare the potato: Wash and scrub the potato with a brush to remove dirt. Fill a tall pot with water (big enough to fit the potato) and place the potato in. Cover the pot with a lid and cook the potato (skin on) until it’s fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Drain out the water and once it’s cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and cut it into cubes.</li>
                            <li>In a large bowl, mix all the sauce ingredients until well combined and set aside until ready to use.</li>
                            <li>Quick Tip for fresh yellow noodles: Normally fresh yellow noodles are oiled. I like to rinse it in cold water to loosen up the threads and remove part of the oil. Or you can quickly blanch it in hot water and drain before use.</li>
                            <li>Heat a wok with 1 tablespoon of oil, then saute garlic until aromatic. Add in the YuChoy and noodles, then toss to combine.</li>
                            <li>Push the ingredients to the side, add a drizzle of oil (if needed) and pour in the plant-based ‘egg’. Let the ‘egg’ cook a little to set then bring the noodles to cover the ‘egg’.</li>
                            <li>Add in the cooked potato cubes, tofu, and slowly add in the sauces. Using a wok spatula or tongs, stir-fry while tossing all the ingredients together until well-combined. Quick tip: Try not to stir too hard or it will break up the noodles into tiny threads.</li>
                            <li>Finally, fold in the mung bean sprouts and cook for another minute or so. If you prefer a softer mung bean sprouts texture, increase the cooking time. Taste test and season to your preference.</li>
                            <li>Garnish with shredded green lettuce, chili slices, fried shallots, and a squeeze of lime juice before serving.</li>
